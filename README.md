# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. This gives a login page which requires user credentials. The credential file is under src/components/LoginCredentials.js

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


## Future Work

1: Display Invalid user credential message when the user login with different credentials


2: Set token and retain session in multiple broswer window

3: Allow different combinations of login credentials
